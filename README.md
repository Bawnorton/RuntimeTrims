# ⚠️ Archived ⚠️ 

Now integrated as part of [Trimica](https://github.com/Bawnorton/Trimica)

This project had too much overhead and technical debt to continue development with my limited time and avaliability, additionally the item model / rendering changes through 1.21.x made incremental version updates more like rewrites hence Trimica skipping all of the intermediary versions and only being made avaliable for the latest (1.21.5 as of writing).

# Runtime Trims

[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/runtimetrims?color=00AF5C&label=downloads&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/runtimetrims)
[![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_1122245_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/runtimetrims)

A library mod that by itself doesn't do anything, however, it allows other mods to inject trim materials and patterns
at runtime allowing for the trim item and armour models to be generated at runtime.
See [DynamicTrim](https://github.com/Bawnorton/Dynamic-Trim) and [AllTheTrims](https://github.com/Bawnorton/AllTheTrims)
for implementations
